# Exciting News: Dr. Jinwoo Gim Joins Memorial University of Newfoundland as a Postdoctoral Researcher

We are thrilled to announce that Dr. Jinwoo Gim, an alumnus of our lab, will be joining Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) in Canada as a postdoctoral researcher. Dr. Gim will be working with Professor Noel Cadigan, a world-renowned scientist in the field of stock assessment. Additionally, MUN will provide full financial support, including salary and travel expenses.

Dr. Jinwoo Gim earned his bachelor's degree from Inha University, followed by a master's degree in 2019 and a PhD in 2023 from Pukyong National University. He has been working as an intern researcher at the National Institute of Fisheries Science in Korea. Recently, he received the exciting news of his acceptance as a postdoctoral researcher at Memorial University.

It is rare for a scientist trained in Korea to receive 100% financial support from a Western university. Typically, Korean-trained scientists going for postdoctoral positions are supported through domestic funds such as the National Research Foundation of Korea. Therefore, this full financial support from an overseas university is an exceptional and celebratory achievement.

Dr. Jinwoo Gim will be leaving for Canada at the end of August and is scheduled to begin working in Professor Noel Cadigan's lab from September.

Memorial University of Newfoundland, located in St. John's, is known for its strong programs in marine biology and fisheries science. The university provides an excellent environment for advanced research and offers numerous opportunities for collaboration and professional growth.

We are immensely proud of Dr. Jinwoo Gim's accomplishment and look forward to the significant contributions he will make in his new role.
